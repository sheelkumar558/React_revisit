# Portfolio website
This is my first attempt of creating a React website from scratch.

# Adressing concerns
1. The usage of hooks is something that needs to be worked on.
2. Passing data between React Components has been done in a questionable way, will be improving on it asap.

Even though the UX is inspired from the Egator channel, the underlying architecture is improved in terms of reusability.
I will continue to build on top of this website to maintain the architecture followed underneath.

## Set up

In the project directory, you can run:
1. `npm install` To load in the dependencies
2. `npm start` Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
